# CS301-Algorithms
This repository contains assignments based on fundamental concepts of algorithms and some python implementations for functional testing, and performance testing. In each assignment file there is a pdf for assignment document and another pdf for the solution. In assignment4, there is also a python implementation.

Concepts covered by the assignments:

* Correctness & asymptotic analysis
* Recurrences
* Testing
* Sorting Algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Linear Sort, Heap Sort, ..)
* Linear-time sorting (Counting Sort and Radix Sort)
* Order statistics
* Randomized algorithms
* Red-black trees
* Augmenting data structures
* Amortized analysis
* Dynamic programming
* Greedy algorithms (MSTs)
* Greedy algorithms (Activity selection, Knapsack)File
* Single source shortest paths algorithms (Dijkstra's)
* Single source shortest paths algorithms (Bellman Ford)File
* All pairs shortest paths algorithms
* Network flows
* NP completeness
